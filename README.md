PlugPlay
========

Plug is an early effort from within the Elixir community to build a Rack-like library that is build around the popular Erlang library of Cowboy. Unfortunately, when first looking into Plug I was disappointed with the documentation. Even with a close reading of the code, it was unclear exactly how to use the finer points of Plug in the fashion that I wanted. Hence, I started writing a commentary in order to better organize my thoughts. I then decided that it would be far better for the Elixir community if I took the extra step to organize my investigation and produce something that might be informative to others. This is the result.

####Disclaimer

I'm not an expert on Elixir or Erlang. I'm nothing more than another Rubyist trying to wrap his head around functional programming and the power of the Erlang VM. I do not claim to possess any special insight into either language. All that I know is what I have gleaned from reading as much code as possible. There is a high probability that I am incorrect in many of my interpretations.

######Please, correct me!

If there is any positive outcome from publicizing my investigation into Plug, I would like to believe that it would result in improving everyone's understanding of Elixir and Plug. For a list of different reasons, I think that Elixir is a formidable option for leaving a mark on the future of software development. However, I think that great documentation and the ability to quickly bring new members into the community through great learning resources is critical. My efforts are solely aimed at effecting that goal so that Elixir and functional programming might reach a broader audience.
